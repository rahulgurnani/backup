1345310 4997588 Redundancy elimination (Vestre, 1991; Chaves, 2003; Koller and Thater, 2006) is the problem of deriving from an USR U another USR U0, such that the readings of U0 are a proper subset of the readings of U, but every reading in U is semantically equivalent to some reading in U0. For instance, the
17406 5742263 To extract such word clusters we used suffix arrays proposed in Yamamoto and Church (2001) and the pointwise mutual information measure, see Church and Hanks (1990)
10987639 4231117 Harbusch et al. (2006) present a generation workbench, which has the goal of producing not the most appropriate order, but all grammatical ones
16479 4231125 In order to ensure this determinism, NLG geared realisers generally rely on theories of grammar which systematically link form to function such as systemic functional grammar (SFG, (Matthiessen and Bateman, 1991)) and, to a lesser extent, Meaning Text Theory (MTT, (Mel’cuk, 1988))
16479 4231125 Similarly, KPML (Matthiessen and Bateman, 1991) assumes access to ideational, interpersonal and textual information which roughly corresponds to semantic, mood/voice, theme/rheme and focus/ground information
473216 4231071 Carpenter, 1976; Griffin and Bock, 2000; Tenenhaus et al., 1995) and recent investigations on computational models for language acquisition and grounding (Siskind, 1995; Roy and Pentland, 2002; Yu and Ballard, 2004), we are particularly interested in two unique questions related to multimodal conversational systems: (1) In a multimodal conversation that involves more complex tasks (e.g., both user initiated tasks and system initiated
473216 4231071 Recent studies have shown that multisensory information (e.g., through vision and language processing) can be combined to effectively acquire words to their perceptually grounded objects in the environment (Siskind, 1995; Roy and Pentland, 2002; Yu and Ballard, 2004)
2182013 5658172 Only three avoided WN altogether (Hendrickx et al., 2007; Bedmar et al., 2007; Aramaki et al., 2006)
2182013 5658172 Many other works manually develop a set of heuristic features devised with some specific relationship in mind, like a WordNet-based meronymy feature (Bedmar et al., 2007) or size-of feature (Aramaki et al., 2006)
2182013 5658172 Since (Hearst, 1992), numerous works have used patterns for discovery and identification of instances of semantic relationships (e.g., (Girju et al., 2006; Snow et al., 2006; Banko et al, 2007))
2383413 5673989 where ܶݎሺݐ|ݐ ᇱሻ denotes the probability that topic term ݐ is the translation of ݐ ᇱ . In our experiments, to estimate the probability ܶݎሺݐ|ݐ ᇱሻ , we used the collections of question titles and question descriptions as the parallel corpus and the IBM model 1 (Brown et al., 1993) as the alignment model
2383413 4231071 they co-occur within the time window . This situation is very similar to the training process of translation models in statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1993), where parallel corpus is used to find the mappings between words from different languages by exploiting their co-occurrence patterns
2383413 4231071 This optimization problem can be solved by the EM algorithm (Brown et al., 1993)
2506099 4231188 tutoring (Litman and Silliman, 2004; Pon-Barry et al., 2006), technical support (Acomb et al., 2007), medication assistance (Allen et al., 2006))
4302130 4905037 Thus, even though it is not easy to automatically identify a player hitting a ball in video, it is easy to detect features that correlate with hitting, e.g., when a scene focusing on the pitching mound immediately jumps to one zooming in on the field (see Figure 1). Although these correlations are not perfect, experiments have shown that baseball events can be classified using such features (Fleischman et al., 2007)
141312 5616851 Although dependency relations have been widely used in automatic acquisition of lexical information, such as detection of polysemy (Lin, 1998) and WSD (McCarthy et al., 2004), their utility in AVC still remains untested
141312 4231023 Our approach is analogous to previous work in extracting collocations from large text corpora using syntactic information (Lin, 1998)
141312 4231023 This observation further supports the distributional hypothesis of word similarity and corresponding technologies for identifying synonyms by similarity of lexical-syntactic context (Lin, 1998)
309114 5658172 A leading method for utilizing context information for classification and extraction of relationships is that of patterns (Hearst, 1992; Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006)
309114 5658172 Since (Hearst, 1992), numerous works have used patterns for discovery and identification of instances of semantic relationships (e.g., (Girju et al., 2006; Snow et al., 2006; Banko et al, 2007))
309114 5013555 For example, we can use automatically extracted hyponymy relations (Hearst, 1992; Shinzato and Torisawa, 2004), or automatically induced MN clusters (Rooth et al., 1999; Torisawa, 2001)
845360 5126930 The most widely used approach derives phrase pairs from word alignment matrix (Och and Ney, 2003; Koehn et al., 2003)
845360 5126930 By combining word alignments in two directions using heuristics (Och and Ney, 2003), a single set of static word alignments is then formed
845360 5126930 Two different word alignment models are trained as the baseline, one is symmetric HMM word alignment model, the other is IBM Model-4 as implemented in the GIZA++ toolkit (Och and Ney, 2003)
845360 4231112 By combining word alignments in two directions using heuristics (Och and Ney, 2003), a single set of static word alignments is then formed
845360 4231112 The baseline translation results (BLEU and TER) on the dev and test set are presented in the line “HMM” of Table 1. We also compare with results of IBM Model-4 word alignments implemented in GIZA++ toolkit (Och and Ney, 2003)
845360 4231112 We simply modify the GIZA++ toolkit (Och and Ney, 2003) by always weighting lexicon probabilities with soft constraints during iterative model training, and obtain 0.7% TER reduction on both sets and 0.4% BLEU improvement on the test set
695115 5153649 We employed leave-one-out resampling (Weiss and Kulikowski, 1991), by correlating the data obtained from each participant with the ratings obtained from all other participants
102893 4930784 Approaches include incorporating a subcategorization feature (Gildea  Jurafsky, 2002; Xue  Palmer, 2004), such as the one used in our baseline; and building a model which jointly classifies all arguments of a verb (Toutanova et al., 2005)
102893 4231023 Parse tree paths were used for semantic role labeling by Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) as descriptive features of the syntactic relationship between predicates and their arguments in the parse tree of a sentence
102893 4231023 Our work suggests that feature generalization based on verb-similarity may compliment approaches to generalization based on role-similarity (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Baldewein et al., 2004)
2145853 4231023 A recent release of the PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) corpus of semantic role annotations of Treebank parses contained 112,917 labeled instances of 4,250 rolesets corresponding to 3,257 verbs, as illustrated by this example for the verb buy
2145853 4231174 This is known as multi-task learning in the machine learning literature (Caruana, 1997; Ben-David and Schuller, 2003; Evgeniou and Pontil, 2004; Micchelli and Pontil, 2005; Maurer, 2006)
2508377 4231174 In this paper, we apply Alternating Structure Optimization (ASO) (Ando and Zhang, 2005a) to the semantic role labeling task on NomBank
2508377 4231174 ASO has been shown to be effective on the following natural language processing tasks: text categorization, named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and word sense disambiguation (Ando and Zhang, 2005a; Ando and Zhang, 2005b; Ando, 2006)
2508377 4231174 For a more complete description, see (Ando and Zhang, 2005a)
2508377 4231174 In this work, we use a modification of Huber’s robust loss function, similar to that used in (Ando and Zhang, 2005a):
2508377 4231174 similar to that used in (Ando and Zhang, 2005a)
2508377 4231174 An important observation in (Ando and Zhang, 2005a) is that the binary classification problems used to derive are not necessarily those problems we are aiming to solve
2508377 4231174 1 Note that this definition deviates slightly from the one in (Ando and Zhang, 2005a)
2508377 4231174 Assuming there are k target problems and m auxiliary problems, it is shown in (Ando and Zhang, 2005a) that by performing one round of minimization, an approximate solution of can be obtained from (4) by the following algorithm:
2508377 4231174 This is a simplified version of the definition in (Ando and Zhang, 2005a), made possible because the same is used for all auxiliary problems
2508377 4231174 ASO has been demonstrated to be an effective semi-supervised learning algorithm (Ando and Zhang, 2005a; Ando and Zhang, 2005b; Ando, 2006)
2508377 4231174 A variety of auxiliary problems are tested in (Ando and Zhang, 2005a; Ando and Zhang, 2005b) in the semi-supervised settings, i.e., their auxiliary problems are generated from unlabeled data
144147 4231117 Since our learner treats all values as nominal, we discretized the values of dep and len with a C4.5 classier (Kohavi  Sahami, 1996)
2370785 5616851 Although there exist several manually-created verb lexicons or ontologies, including Levin’s verb taxonomy, VerbNet, and FrameNet, automatic verb classification (AVC) is still necessary for extending existing lexicons (Korhonen and Briscoe, 2004), building and tuning lexical information specific to different domains (Korhonen et al., 2006), and bootstrapping verb lexicons for new languages (Tsang et al., 2002)
2034028 4905037 The traditional text-only language models (which are also used below as baseline comparisons) are generated with the SRI language modeling toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) using Chen and Goodman's modified Kneser-Ney discounting and interpolation (Chen and Goodman, 1998)
2034028 4231112 The language model is a statistical trigram model estimated with Modified Kneser-Ney smoothing (Chen and Goodman, 1996) using all English sentences in the parallel training data
2394009 4930784 A relatively straight-forward extension of the inside-outside algorithm for chart-parses allows us to learn and perform inference in our compact representation (a similar algorithm is presented in (Geman  Johnson, 2002))
31 5274910 Representing feature spaces with this kind of tree, besides often coinciding with the explicit language used by common natural language toolkits (Cohen, 2004), has the added benefit of allowing a model to easily back-off, or smooth, to decreasing levels of specificity
31 5274910 We used a standard natural language toolkit (Cohen, 2004) to compute tens of thousands of binary features on each of these tokens, encoding such information as capitalization patterns and contextual information from surrounding words
35299 5673989 Question answering (e.g., Pasca and Harabagiu, 2001; Echihabi and Marcu, 2003; Voorhees, 2004; Metzler and Croft, 2005) relates to question search
648944 4231125 A Feature-based TAG (FTAG, (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1988)) consists of a set of (auxiliary or initial) elementary trees and of two tree composition operations: substitution and adjunction
2414885 4231117 Finally, the articles are parsed with the CDG dependency parser (Foth  Menzel, 2006)
4993738 5658172 Only three avoided WN altogether (Hendrickx et al., 2007; Bedmar et al., 2007; Aramaki et al., 2006)
4993738 5658172 Freely available tools like Weka (Witten and Frank, 1999) allow easy experimentation with common learning algorithms (Hendrickx et al., 2007)
4993738 5658172 In this paper we did not focus on a single ML algorithm, letting algorithm selection be automatically based on cross-validation results on the training set, as in (Hendrickx et al., 2007) but using more algorithms and allowing a more flexible parameter choice
2377808 5185699 evaluated with both MAP (mean average precision) and gMAP (geometric mean average precision) (Voorhees, 2005), which emphasizes the performance of difficulty queries
2145504 4231115 First, we use the standard approach of greedily assigning each of the learned classes to the POS tag with which it has the greatest overlap, and then computing tagging accuracy (Smith and Eisner, 2005; Haghighi and Klein, 2006).8 Additionally, we
4639227 4231096 In addition to these basic types, several studies deal with the discovery and labeling of more specific relation sub-types, including inter-verb relations (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) and nouncompound relationships (Moldovan et al, 2004)
4639227 4231096 It should be noted that some of these papers utilize language and domain-dependent preprocessing including syntactic parsing (Suchanek et al, 2006) and named entity tagging (Hasegawa et al, 2004), while others take advantage of handcrafted databases such as WordNet (Moldovan et al, 2004; Costello et al, 2006) and Wikipedia (Strube and Ponzetto, 2006)
2385406 4231096 In addition to these basic types, several studies deal with the discovery and labeling of more specific relation sub-types, including inter-verb relations (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) and nouncompound relationships (Moldovan et al, 2004)
2077868 4905037 before, during, etc. ) (Allen, 1984). The algorithm keeps track of how often each of these relations is observed, and after the entire video corpus is analyzed, uses chi-square analyses to determine which relations are significant
845318 4231115 For both experiments, we used dependency trees extracted from the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) using the head rules and dependency extractor from Yamada and Matsumoto (2003)
503349 6340884 Perhaps the best known are Query by Committee (QBC) (Seung et al., 1992) and uncertainty sampling (or Query by Uncertainty, QBU) (Thrun and Moeller, 1992)
1270402 4231117 The TnT tagger (Brants, 2000) and the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1997) are used for tagging and lemmatization
4683321 4231125 To associate semantic representations with natural language expressions, the FTAG is modified as proposed in (Gardent and Kallmeyer, 2003)
4683321 4231125 The proposal draws on ideas from (Koller and Striegnitz, 2002; Gardent and Kow, 2005) and aims to determine whether for a given input (a set of TAG elementary trees whose semantics equate the input semantics), syntactic requirements and resources cancel out
4683321 4231125 We refer the reader to (Koller and Striegnitz, 2002; Gardent and Kow, 2005) for more details

4416974 5452627 Other than for email summarization, other document summarization methods have adopted graphranking algorithms for summarization, e.g., (Wan et al., 2007), (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) and (Erkan and Radev, 2004)
166772 4231183 The DSO corpus (Ng and Lee, 1996) contains 192,800 annotated examples for 121 nouns and 70 verbs, drawn from BC and WSJ
38081 4231023 In future work, it would be particularly interesting to compare empiricallyderived verb clusters to verb classes derived from theoretical considerations (Levin, 1993), and to the automated verb classification techniques that use these classes (Joanis and Stevenson, 2003)

1865646 5529044 Fox (2002) showed that cohesion is held in the vast majority of cases for English-French, while Cherry and Lin (2006) have shown it to be a strong feature for word alignment
1865646 5529044 Previous approaches to measuring the cohesion of a sentence pair have worked with a word alignment (Fox, 2002; Lin and Cherry, 2003)
1865646 5529044 Fox (2002) demonstrated and counted cases where cohesion was not maintained in handaligned sentence-pairs, while Cherry and Lin (2006)
4231148 4930784 Another area of related work in the semantic role labeling literature is that on tree kernels (Moschitti, 2004; Zhang et al., 2007)
2159636 4905037 We follow previous work in sports video processing (Gong et al., 2004) and define an event in a baseball video as any sequence of shots starting with a pitching-scene and continuing for four subsequent shots
39303757 5590651 The other two English dictionary transcriptions were produced in a similar way from the Buckeye corpus (Pitt et al., 2005; Pitt et al., 2007) and Mississippi State’s corrected version of the LDC’s Switchboard transcripts (Godfrey and Holliman, 1994; Deshmukh et al., 1998)
2374516 5616851 3 We also tried Chang and Lin (2001)’s LIBSVM library for
1823 4860637 The idea of selectively sampling training samples has been wildly discussed in machine learning theory (Seung et al., 1992) and has been applied successfully to several NLP applications (McCallum and Nigam, 1998)
2446635 5658172 Since (Hearst, 1992), numerous works have used patterns for discovery and identification of instances of semantic relationships (e.g., (Girju et al., 2006; Snow et al., 2006; Banko et al, 2007))
3727296 4231023 Annotations similar to these have been used to create automated semantic role labeling systems (Pradhan et al., 2005; Moschitti et al., 2006) for use in natural language processing applications that require only shallow semantic parsing
3727296 4231023 The overall performance of our semantic role labeling approach is not competitive with leading contemporary systems, which typically employ support vector machine learning algorithms with syntactic features (Pradhan et al., 2005) or syntactic tree kernels (Moschitti et al., 2006)

385869 4231115 For both experiments, we used dependency trees extracted from the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) using the head rules and dependency extractor from Yamada and Matsumoto (2003)
2414989 4231057 For example, incremental CFG parsing algorithms can be used with the CFGs produced by this transform, as can the Inside-Outside estimation algorithm (Lari and Young, 1990) and more exotic methods such as estimating adjoined hidden states (Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Petrov et al., 2006)
2284234 5616851 The software performs the socalled 1-of-k classification (Madigan et al., 2005)
2409686 4231174 Noun predicates also appear in FrameNet semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), and many FrameNet SRL systems are evaluated in Senseval-3 (Litkowski, 2004)
577252 4966143 To experiment with our models, we built two different corpora, WEB-QA and TREC-QA by using the description questions from TREC 2001 (Voorhees, 2001) and annotating the answers retrieved from Web resp
2374026 4930784 Approaches include incorporating a subcategorization feature (Gildea  Jurafsky, 2002; Xue  Palmer, 2004), such as the one used in our baseline; and building a model which jointly classifies all arguments of a verb (Toutanova et al., 2005)
2922658 4905037 The WEKA machine learning package is used to train a boosted decision tree to classify these frames into one of three categories: pitching-scene, field-scene, other (Witten and Frank, 2005) . Those shots whose key frames are classified as field-scenes are then subcategorized (using boosted decision trees) into one of the following categories: infield, outfield, wall, base, running, and misc
1766544 4231096 Studying relationships between tagged named entities, (Hasegawa et al, 2004; Hassan et al, 2006) proposed unsupervised clustering methods that assign given (or semi-automatically extracted) sets of pairs into several clusters, where each cluster corresponds to one of a known relationship type
1766544 4231096 It should be noted that some of these papers utilize language and domain-dependent preprocessing including syntactic parsing (Suchanek et al, 2006) and named entity tagging (Hasegawa et al, 2004), while others take advantage of handcrafted databases such as WordNet (Moldovan et al, 2004; Costello et al, 2006) and Wikipedia (Strube and Ponzetto, 2006)
2363036 4231174 ASO has been shown to be effective on the following natural language processing tasks: text categorization, named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and word sense disambiguation (Ando and Zhang, 2005a; Ando and Zhang, 2005b; Ando, 2006)
2363036 4231174 ASO has been demonstrated to be an effective semi-supervised learning algorithm (Ando and Zhang, 2005a; Ando and Zhang, 2005b; Ando, 2006)
2363036 4231174 A variety of auxiliary problems are tested in (Ando and Zhang, 2005a; Ando and Zhang, 2005b) in the semi-supervised settings, i.e., their auxiliary problems are generated from unlabeled data
2363036 4231174 While (Ando and Zhang, 2005b) uses “predicting used features” (previous/current/next word) as auxiliary problems with good results in named entity recognition, the use of similar observable auxiliary problems in our work gives no statistically significant improvements
110183 4231207 In this paper, we make this perspective explicit by translating the sentence generation problem of TAG grammars with semantic and pragmatic information into a planning problem stated in the widely used Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL, McDermott (2000))
110183 4231207 PDDL (McDermott, 2000) is the standard input language for modern planning systems
368362 4231096 Most related work deals with discovery of hypernymy (Hearst, 1992; Pantel et al, 2004), synonymy (Roark and Charniak, 1998; Widdows and Dorow, 2002; Davidov and Rappoport, 2006) and meronymy (Berland and Charniak, 1999)
443543 4231096 Most related work deals with discovery of hypernymy (Hearst, 1992; Pantel et al, 2004), synonymy (Roark and Charniak, 1998; Widdows and Dorow, 2002; Davidov and Rappoport, 2006) and meronymy (Berland and Charniak, 1999)
1968466 4231125 Reversible realisers. The realiser presented here differs in mainly two ways from existing reversible realisers such as (White, 2004)’s CCG system or the HPSG ERG based realiser (Carroll and Oepen, 2005)
2043904 5616851 We also lemmatize each word using the English lemmatizer as described in Minnen et al. (2000), and use lemmas as features instead of words
631143 5185699 Query expansion (Voorhees, 1994; Mandala et al., 1999a; Fang and Zhai, 2006; Qiu and Frei, 1993; Bai et al., 2005; Cao et al., 2005) is a commonly used strategy to bridge the vocabulary gaps by expanding original queries with related terms
631143 5185699 Expanded terms are often selected from either co-occurrence-based thesauri (Qiu and Frei, 1993; Bai et al., 2005; Jing and Croft, 1994; Peat and Willett, 1991; Smeaton and van Rijsbergen, 1983; Fang and Zhai, 2006) or handcrafted thesauri (Voorhees, 1994; Liu et al., 2004) or both (Cao et al., 2005; Mandala et al., 1999b)
631143 5185699 However, previous studies failed to show any significant gain in retrieval performance when queries are expanded with terms selected from WordNet (Voorhees, 1994; Stairmand, 1997)
631143 5185699 Voorhees (Voorhees, 1994) expanded queries using a combination of synonyms, hypernyms and hyponyms manually selected from WordNet, and achieved limited improvement (i.e., around −2% to +2%) on short verbose queries
631143 5185699 By incorporating this similarity function into the axiomatic retrieval models, we show that query expansion using the information from only WordNet can lead to significant improvement of retrieval performance, which has not been shown in the previous studies (Voorhees, 1994; Stairmand, 1997)
631143 5185699 We first compare the retrieval performance of query expansion with different similarity functions using short keyword (i.e., title-only) queries, because query expansion techniques are often more effective for shorter queries (Voorhees, 1994; Fang and Zhai, 2006)
2047122 4231183 For WSD, Fujii et al. (1998) used selective sampling for a Japanese language WSD system, Chen et al. (2006) used active learning for 5 verbs using coarse-grained evaluation, and H. T. Dang (2004) employed active learning for another set of 5 verbs
4138526 4231196 Models of this type have previously been shown to yield very good g2p conversion results (Bisani and Ney, 2002; Galescu and Allen, 2001; Chen, 2003)
4138526 4231196 (Chen, 2003) also used a joint n-gram model
908807 4905037 Recent work in automatic image annotation (Barnard et al., 2003; Blei and Jordan, 2003) and natural language processing (Steyvers et al., 2004), however, have demonstrated the advantages of using hierarchical Bayesian models for related tasks
908807 4905037 In this work we follow closely the Author-Topic (AT) model (Steyvers et al., 2004) which is a generalization of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2005)
721528 5658172 The winning algorithms were LWL (Atkeson et al., 1997), SMO (Platt, 1999), and K* (Cleary and Trigg, 1995) (there were 7 tasks, and different algorithms could be selected for each task)
15813 5616851 It is therefore unsurprising that much work on verb classification has adopted them as features (Schulte im Walde, 2000; Brew and Schulte im Walde, 2002; Korhonen et al., 2003)
2441172 4994026 These simple techniques are capable of modeling local topics without more expensive modeling of topic transitions used in (Griffiths et al., 2004; Wang and McCallum, 2005; Wallach, 2006; Gruber et al., 2007)
2122945 4231077 To perform translation, state-of-the-art MT systems use a statistical phrase-based approach (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004) by treating phrases as the basic units of translation
800432 6294835 These range from supervised classification (Vailaya et al., 2001; Smeulders et al., 2000) to instantiations of the noisy-channel model (Duygulu et al., 2002), to clustering (Barnard et al., 2002), and methods inspired by information retrieval (Lavrenko et al., 2003; Feng et al., 2004)
800432 6294835 The earliest approaches are closely related to image classification (Vailaya et al., 2001; Smeulders et al., 2000), where pictures are assigned a set of simple descriptions such as indoor, outdoor, landscape, people, animal
4727037 4930784 Another group of related work focuses on summarizing sentences through a series of deletions (Jing, 2000; Dorr et al., 2003; Galley  McKeown, 2007)
826247 5185699 Expanded terms are often selected from either co-occurrence-based thesauri (Qiu and Frei, 1993; Bai et al., 2005; Jing and Croft, 1994; Peat and Willett, 1991; Smeaton and van Rijsbergen, 1983; Fang and Zhai, 2006) or handcrafted thesauri (Voorhees, 1994; Liu et al., 2004) or both (Cao et al., 2005; Mandala et al., 1999b)
424285 4966143 To experiment with our models, we built two different corpora, WEB-QA and TREC-QA by using the description questions from TREC 2001 (Voorhees, 2001) and annotating the answers retrieved from Web resp
3164012 4905037 (for a review see Roy, 2005, and Roy and Reiter, 2005)
4242681 5658172 Some other systems that avoided using the labels used WN as a supporting resource for their algorithms (Costello, 2007; Nakov and Hearst, 2007; Kim and Baldwin, 2007)
4242681 5658172 Rosenfeld and Feldman (2007) discover relationship instances by clustering entities appearing in similar contexts
259468 4231096 However, each of these assumes that the relations themselves are known in advance (implicitly or explicitly) so that the method can be provided with seed patterns (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Pantel et al, 2004), pattern-based rules (Etzioni et al, 2004), relation keywords (Sekine, 2006), or word pairs exemplifying relation instances (Pasca et al, 2006; Alfonseca et al, 2006; Rosenfeld and Feldman, 2006)
1809513 4231125 The proposal draws on ideas from (Koller and Striegnitz, 2002; Gardent and Kow, 2005) and aims to determine whether for a given input (a set of TAG elementary trees whose semantics equate the input semantics), syntactic requirements and resources cancel out
1809513 4231125 We refer the reader to (Koller and Striegnitz, 2002; Gardent and Kow, 2005) for more details
4572760 4905037 The method is based on the use of grounded language models to represent the relationship between words and the nonlinguistic context to which they refer (Fleischman and Roy, 2007)
4572760 4905037 (see Fleischman and Roy, 2007 for the full list of low level features used)
4572760 4905037 Queries are generated artificially using a method similar to Berger and Lafferty (1999) and used in Fleischman and Roy (2007)
368811 4905037 We use the system of Bouthemy et al. (1999) which computes the camera motion using the parameters of a twodimensional affine model to fit every pair of sequential frames in a video
1967060 5616851 WordNet). Although the problem of data sparsity is alleviated to certain extent (3), these features do not generally improve classification performance (Schulte im Walde, 2000; Joanis, 2002)
5679 4231077 Hiero uses a general log-linear model (Och and Ney, 2002) where the weight of a derivation D for a particular source sentence and its translation is w(D) = Y
5679 4231112 These feature weights are tuned on the dev set to achieve optimal translation performance using downhill simplex method (Och and Ney, 2002)
165757 4231057 Since CFGs can be expressed as Horn-clause logic programs (Pereira and Shieber, 1987) and the Unfold-Fold transformation is provably correct for such programs (Sato, 1992; Pettorossi and Proeitti, 1992), it follows that its application to CFGs is provably correct as well
10114551 4231196 Decision trees were one of the first data-based approaches to g2p and are still widely used (Kienappel and Kneser, 2001; Black et al., 1998)
1704923 4905037 Recognizing speech in broadcast video is a necessary precursor to many multimodal applications such as video search and summarization (Snoek and Worring, 2005;)
1782520 4231023 An important area for future research will be to explore the correlation between our distance metric for syntactic similarity and various quantitative measures of semantic similarity (Pedersen, et al., 2004)
2182006 4231117 E.g., in text-to-text generation (Barzilay  McKeown, 2005; Marsi  Krahmer, 2005; Wan et al., 2005), new sentences are fused from dependency structures of input sentences
35930 5616851 Although there exist several manually-created verb lexicons or ontologies, including Levin’s verb taxonomy, VerbNet, and FrameNet, automatic verb classification (AVC) is still necessary for extending existing lexicons (Korhonen and Briscoe, 2004), building and tuning lexical information specific to different domains (Korhonen et al., 2006), and bootstrapping verb lexicons for new languages (Tsang et al., 2002)
3715440 4231023 Our work suggests that feature generalization based on verb-similarity may compliment approaches to generalization based on role-similarity (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Baldewein et al., 2004)
845552 5673989 where ܶݎሺݐ|ݐ ᇱሻ denotes the probability that topic term ݐ is the translation of ݐ ᇱ . In our experiments, to estimate the probability ܶݎሺݐ|ݐ ᇱሻ , we used the collections of question titles and question descriptions as the parallel corpus and the IBM model 1 (Brown et al., 1993) as the alignment model
845552 4231071 they co-occur within the time window . This situation is very similar to the training process of translation models in statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1993), where parallel corpus is used to find the mappings between words from different languages by exploiting their co-occurrence patterns
845552 4231071 This optimization problem can be solved by the EM algorithm (Brown et al., 1993)
94110 4231148 Kashima and Koyanagi (2003) proposed a convolution kernel over labeled order trees by generalizing the standard convolution tree kernel
2414995 4139591 An SCFG (Lewis and Stearns, 1968) is a context-free rewriting system for generating string pairs
630783 5185699 However, previous studies failed to show any significant gain in retrieval performance when queries are expanded with terms selected from WordNet (Voorhees, 1994; Stairmand, 1997)
630783 5185699 Stairmand (Stairmand, 1997) used WordNet for query expansion, but they concluded that the improvement was restricted by the coverage of the WordNet and no empirical results were reported
630783 5185699 By incorporating this similarity function into the axiomatic retrieval models, we show that query expansion using the information from only WordNet can lead to significant improvement of retrieval performance, which has not been shown in the previous studies (Voorhees, 1994; Stairmand, 1997)
53284 4231052 BLEU score using the algorithm described in (Och, 2003)
1831717 4905037 Shot detection and segmentation is a well studied problem; in this work we use the method of Tardini et al. (2005)
115479 4231117 Unlike overgeneration approaches (Varges  Mellish, 2001, inter alia) which select the best of all possible outputs ours is more efcient, because we do not need to generate every permutation
49119 4231096 In several studies (e.g., Widdows and Dorow, 2002; Pantel et al, 2004; Davidov and Rappoport, 2006) it has been shown that relatively unsupervised and language-independent methods could be used to generate many thousands of sets of words whose semantics is similar in some sense
49119 4231096 Most related work deals with discovery of hypernymy (Hearst, 1992; Pantel et al, 2004), synonymy (Roark and Charniak, 1998; Widdows and Dorow, 2002; Davidov and Rappoport, 2006) and meronymy (Berland and Charniak, 1999)
1834583 5658172 Other resources used for relationship discovery include Wikipedia (Strube and Ponzetto, 2006), thesauri or synonym sets (Turney, 2005) and domainspecific semantic hierarchies like MeSH (Rosario and Hearst, 2001)
1834583 5658172 hierarchy and a corresponding dataset were used in (Turney, 2005; Turney, 2006) and (Nastase et al., 2006) for evaluation of their algorithms
1834583 5658172 We have used the exact evaluation procedure described in (Turney, 2006), achieving a class f-score average of 60.1, as opposed to 54.6 in (Turney, 2005) and 51.2 in (Nastase et al., 2006)
4231182 5616851 SCF and DR: These more linguistically informed features are constructed based on the grammatical relations generated by the CC CCG parser (Clark and Curran, 2007)
2464777 5658172 Relationship classification is known to improve many practical tasks, e.g., textual entailment (Tatu and Moldovan, 2005)
631142 5185699 Voorhees (Voorhees, 1993) showed that using Word-Net for word sense disambiguation degrade the retrieval performance
2142135 4930784 Approaches include incorporating a subcategorization feature (Gildea  Jurafsky, 2002; Xue  Palmer, 2004), such as the one used in our baseline; and building a model which jointly classifies all arguments of a verb (Toutanova et al., 2005)
2510330 5616851  or sufficient for us to draw firm conclusions about its usage, the information about the class to which the verb type belongs can compensate for it, addressing the pervasive problem of data sparsity in a wide range of NLP tasks, such as automatic extraction of subcategorization frames (Korhonen, 2002), semantic role labeling (Swier and Stevenson, 2004; Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), natural language generation for machine translation (Habash et
2165038 5658172 Several different relationship hierarchies have been proposed (Nastase and Szpakowicz, 2003; Moldovan et al., 2004)
2165038 5658172 Nastase and Szpakowicz (2003) proposed a two-level hierarchy with 5 (30) classes at the top (bottom) levels 3. This
2165038 5658172 For each parameter we have estimated its desired range using the (Nastase and Szpakowicz, 2003) set as a development set
2165038 5658172 Since the SemEval dataset is of a very specific nature, we have also applied our classification framework to the (Nastase and Szpakowicz, 2003) dataset, which contains 600 pairs labeled with 5 main relationship types
1766593 5616851 Although dependency relations have been widely used in automatic acquisition of lexical information, such as detection of polysemy (Lin, 1998) and WSD (McCarthy et al., 2004), their utility in AVC still remains untested
2073437 4905037 Although performance is often reasonable in controlled environments (such as studio news rooms), automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have significant difficulty in noisier settings (such as those found in live sports broadcasts) (Wactlar et al., 1996)
2073437 4905037 Such video IR systems often use speech transcriptions to index segments of video in much the same way that words are used to index text documents (Wactlar et al., 1996)
5559010 4231117 E.g., in text-to-text generation (Barzilay  McKeown, 2005; Marsi  Krahmer, 2005; Wan et al., 2005), new sentences are fused from dependency structures of input sentences
22606 4231117 We provide evidence that the task requires language-specic knowledge to achieve better results and point to the most difcult part of it. Similar to Langkilde  Knight (1998) we utilize statistical methods
6200749 4231151 (Knight and Graehl, 1998; Meng et al., 2001; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002; Gao et al., 2004) — has mostly assumed that one has a training lexicon of transliteration pairs, from which one can learn a model, often a sourcechannel or MaxEnt-based model
2414975 5616851 Although there exist several manually-created verb lexicons or ontologies, including Levin’s verb taxonomy, VerbNet, and FrameNet, automatic verb classification (AVC) is still necessary for extending existing lexicons (Korhonen and Briscoe, 2004), building and tuning lexical information specific to different domains (Korhonen et al., 2006), and bootstrapping verb lexicons for new languages (Tsang et al., 2002)
1834611 5658172 This corpus was extracted from the web starting from open directory links, comprising English web pages with varied topics and styles (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2005)
4563862 5658172 Some other systems that avoided using the labels used WN as a supporting resource for their algorithms (Costello, 2007; Nakov and Hearst, 2007; Kim and Baldwin, 2007)
2384515 5658172 named entity annotation (Pantel et al., 2004)
2384515 4231096 In several studies (e.g., Widdows and Dorow, 2002; Pantel et al, 2004; Davidov and Rappoport, 2006) it has been shown that relatively unsupervised and language-independent methods could be used to generate many thousands of sets of words whose semantics is similar in some sense
2384515 4231096 Most related work deals with discovery of hypernymy (Hearst, 1992; Pantel et al, 2004), synonymy (Roark and Charniak, 1998; Widdows and Dorow, 2002; Davidov and Rappoport, 2006) and meronymy (Berland and Charniak, 1999)
2384515 4231096 Studying relationships between tagged named entities, (Hasegawa et al, 2004; Hassan et al, 2006) proposed unsupervised clustering methods that assign given (or semi-automatically extracted) sets of pairs into several clusters, where each cluster corresponds to one of a known relationship type
2384515 4231096 However, each of these assumes that the relations themselves are known in advance (implicitly or explicitly) so that the method can be provided with seed patterns (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Pantel et al, 2004), pattern-based rules (Etzioni et al, 2004), relation keywords (Sekine, 2006), or word pairs exemplifying relation instances (Pasca et al, 2006; Alfonseca et al, 2006; Rosenfeld and Feldman, 2006)
2464788 4231112 Ittycheriah and Roukos (2005); Moore (2005); Blunsom and Cohn (2006), have received great amount of study recently
649061 4231117 The work of Uchimoto et al. (2000) is done on the free word order language Japanese
649061 4231117 plemented the algorithm of Uchimoto et al. (2000)
649061 4231117 Apart from acc and , we also adopt the metrics used by Uchimoto et al. (2000) and Ringger et al. (2004)
870581 5616851 Following studies on automatic SCF extraction (Brent, 1993), we apply a statistical test (Binomial Hypothesis Test) to the unfiltered-Levin-SCF to filter out noisy SCFs, and denote the resulting SCF set as filtered-Levin-SCF
496230 4231207 While there have been previous systems that encode generation as planning (Cohen and Perrault, 1979; Appelt, 1985; Heeman and Hirst, 1995), our approach is distinguished from these systems by its focus on the grammatically specified contributions of each individual word (and the TAG tree it anchors) to syntax, semantics, and local pragmatics (Hobbs et al., 1993)
5501233 4231174 ASO has been shown to be effective on the following natural language processing tasks: text categorization, named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and word sense disambiguation (Ando and Zhang, 2005a; Ando and Zhang, 2005b; Ando, 2006)
5501233 4231174 ASO has been demonstrated to be an effective semi-supervised learning algorithm (Ando and Zhang, 2005a; Ando and Zhang, 2005b; Ando, 2006)
5501233 4231174 More recently, for the word sense disambiguation (WSD) task, (Ando, 2006) experimented with both supervised and semi-supervised auxiliary problems, although the auxiliary problems she used are different from ours
787230 4231077 Hiero (Chiang, 2005) is a hierarchical phrase-based model for statistical machine translation, based on weighted synchronous context-free grammar (CFG) (Lewis and Stearns, 1968)
4144153 4231183 In applying active learning for domain adaptation, Zhang et al. (2003) presented work on sentence boundary detection using generalized Winnow, while Tur et al. (2004) performed language model adaptation of automatic speech recognition systems
22851 4231023 In particular, our approach would be applicable to corpora with framespecific role labels, e.g. FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998)
168030 4231117 6 E.g. DefDet, Coords, Possr, werden 7 We use the CMU Toolkit (Clarkson  Rosenfeld, 1997)
2464493 4231174 So far we are aware of only one English NomBank-based SRL system (Jiang and Ng, 2006), which uses the maximum entropy classifier, although similar efforts are reported on the Chinese NomBank by (Xue, 2006) and on FrameNet by (Pradhan et al., 2004) using a small set of hand-selected nominalizations
2464493 4231174 Second, we achieve accuracy higher than that reported in (Jiang and Ng, 2006) and advance the state of the art in SRL research
2464493 4231174 Eighteen baseline features and six additional features are proposed in (Jiang and Ng, 2006) for Nom-Bank argument identification
2464493 4231174 Unlike in (Jiang and Ng, 2006), we do not prune arguments dominated by other arguments or those that overlap with the predicate in the training data
2464493 4231174 The J&N column presents the result reported in (Jiang and Ng, 2006) using both baseline and additional features
2464493 4231174 To find a smaller set of effective features, we start with all the features considered in (Jiang and Ng, 2006), in (Xue and Palmer, 2004), and various combinations of them, for a total of 52 features
2464493 4231174 The J&N column presents the result reported in (Jiang and Ng, 2006)
2464493 4231174 This is the same configuration as reported in (Pradhan et al., 2005; Jiang and Ng, 2006)
2464493 4231174 Our maximum entropy classifier consistently outperforms (Jiang and Ng, 2006), which also uses a maximum entropy classifier
2464493 4231174 Our results outperform those reported in (Jiang and Ng, 2006)
4789796 5616851 Other methods for combining syntactic information with lexical information have also been attempted (Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Joanis et al., 2007)
4789796 5616851 Joanis et al. (2007) reports an experiment that involves 15 Levin verb classes
4789796 5616851 Joanis et al. (2007) demonstrates that the general feature space they devise achieves a rate of error reduction ranging from 48% to 88% over a chance baseline accuracy, across classification tasks of varying difficulty
4789796 5616851 Table 1: Results from Joanis et al. (2007) (%)
4789796 5616851 However, some of the functions words, prepositions in particular, are known to carry great amount of syntactic information that is related to lexical meanings of verbs (Schulte im Walde, 2003; Brew and Schulte im Walde, 2002; Joanis et al., 2007)
4789796 5616851 Joanis et al. (2007), which consists of 224 features
4789796 5616851 Joanis15: Joanis et al. (2007) manually selects pairs, or triples of classes to represent a range of distinctions that exist among the 15 classes they investigate
4789796 5616851 For example, Schulte im Walde (2000) uses 153 verbs in 30 classes, and Joanis et al. (2007) takes on 835 verbs and 15 verb classes
4789796 5616851 With those manually-selected 15 classes, Joanis et al. (2007) conducts 11 classification tasks including six 2-way classifications, two 3-way classifications, one 6-way classification, one 8-way classification, and one 14-way classification
4789796 5616851 The results for the 11 classification tasks are summarized in table 5. We provide a chance baseline and the accuracy reported in Joanis et al. (2007) 4 for
4789796 5616851 4 Joanis et al. (2007) is different from our experiments in that
4789796 5616851 and JOANIS07 yield similar accuracy in our experiments, which agrees with the findings in Joanis et al. (2007) (compare table 1 and 5)
2290211 4231174 So far we are aware of only one English NomBank-based SRL system (Jiang and Ng, 2006), which uses the maximum entropy classifier, although similar efforts are reported on the Chinese NomBank by (Xue, 2006) 208 and on FrameNet by (Pradhan et al., 2004) using a small set of hand-selected nominalizations
3221004 4231109 However, few of these methods have explicitly addressed the tension between word alignments and the syntactic processes that employ them (Cherry and Lin, 2006; Daum´e III and Marcu, 2005; Lopez and Resnik, 2005)
3221004 4231109 Lopez and Resnik (2005) considers a simpler tree distance distortion model
1278889 5153649 Specifically, they belonged to different synsets and were maximally dissimilar as measured by the Jiang and Conrath (1997) measure.3
3331459 4231117 Ringger et al. (2004) aim at regenerating the order of constituents as well as the order within them for German and French technical manuals
3331459 4231117 Similar to Ringger et al. (2004), we nd the order with the highest probability conditioned on syntactic and semantic categories
3331459 4231117 Ringger et al. (2004) do not make explicit, what their set of semantic relations consists of. From the
3331459 4231117 Apart from acc and , we also adopt the metrics used by Uchimoto et al. (2000) and Ringger et al. (2004)
3331459 4231117 Unlike , which has 1 as the lowest score, agr ranges from 0 to 1. Ringger et al. (2004) evaluate the performance only in terms of per-constituent edit distance calculated as m N , where m is the minimum number of moves 11
3331459 4231117 According to the inv metric, our results are considerably worse than those reported by Ringger et al. (2004)
4231145 5122856 We carried out automatic evaluation of our summaries using ROUGE (Lin, 2004) toolkit, which has been widely adopted by DUC for automatic summarization evaluation
346030 4231023 To prepare this corpus for analysis, we extracted the body text from each of the 4.1 million entries in the corpus and applied a maximum-entropy algorithm to identify sentence boundaries (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997)
695121 5658172 Freely available tools like Weka (Witten and Frank, 1999) allow easy experimentation with common learning algorithms (Hendrickx et al., 2007)
285244 4905037 Because these transcriptions are not necessarily time synched with the audio, we use the method described in Hauptmann and Witbrock (1998) to align the closed captioning to the announcers’ speech
2382144 4977341 The resulting parser was tested on a test corpus of hand-parsed sentences from the Genia Treebank (Tateisi et al., 2005)
849393 4231083 For this purpose we first construct random inventories and then perform a two sample t-test (Cohen, 1995) comparing the RRs of the real and the random inventories
2165315 5658172 A leading method for utilizing context information for classification and extraction of relationships is that of patterns (Hearst, 1992; Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006)
2165315 5658172 Other resources used for relationship discovery include Wikipedia (Strube and Ponzetto, 2006), thesauri or synonym sets (Turney, 2005) and domainspecific semantic hierarchies like MeSH (Rosario and Hearst, 2001)
2165315 5658172 Strategies were developed for discovery of multiple patterns for some specified lexical relationship (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006) and for unsupervised pattern ranking (Turney, 2006)
2165315 4231096 In several studies (e.g., Widdows and Dorow, 2002; Pantel et al, 2004; Davidov and Rappoport, 2006) it has been shown that relatively unsupervised and language-independent methods could be used to generate many thousands of sets of words whose semantics is similar in some sense
2165315 4231096 Most related work deals with discovery of hypernymy (Hearst, 1992; Pantel et al, 2004), synonymy (Roark and Charniak, 1998; Widdows and Dorow, 2002; Davidov and Rappoport, 2006) and meronymy (Berland and Charniak, 1999)
2165315 4231096 In some recent work (Strube and Ponzetto, 2006), it has been shown that related pairs can be generated without pre-specifying the nature of the relation sought
2165315 4231096 It should be noted that some of these papers utilize language and domain-dependent preprocessing including syntactic parsing (Suchanek et al, 2006) and named entity tagging (Hasegawa et al, 2004), while others take advantage of handcrafted databases such as WordNet (Moldovan et al, 2004; Costello et al, 2006) and Wikipedia (Strube and Ponzetto, 2006)
2165315 4231096 We do this as follows, essentially implementing a simplified version of the method of Davidov and Rappoport (2006)
2165315 4231096 It was shown in (Davidov and Rappoport, 2006) that pairs of words that often appear together in such symmetric patterns tend to belong to the same class (that is, they share some notable aspect of their semantics)
2165315 4231096 Note that our method differs from that of Davidov and Rappoport (2006) in that here we provide an initial seed pair, representing our target concept, while there the goal is grouping of as many words as possible into concept classes
1383708 4231183 Among the few currently available manually sense-annotated corpora for WSD, the SEMCOR (SC) corpus (Miller et al., 1994) is the most widely used
5442340 5658172 2 In (Davidov and Rappoport, 2008) we focus on the pat-
5442340 5658172 In (Davidov and Rappoport, 2008) we present an approach to extract pattern clusters from an untagged corpus
5442340 5658172 In (Davidov and Rappoport, 2008) we describe the algorithm at length, discuss its behavior and parameters in detail, and evaluate its intrinsic quality
81067 4905037 Recent work in automatic image annotation (Barnard et al., 2003; Blei and Jordan, 2003) and natural language processing (Steyvers et al., 2004), however, have demonstrated the advantages of using hierarchical Bayesian models for related tasks
2371752 4930784 Table 2 shows results of these three systems on the Conll-2005 task, plus the top-performing system (Punyakanok et al., 2005) for reference
4640573 5658172 Common choices include variations of SVM (Girju et al., 2004; Nastase et al., 2006), decision trees and memory-based learners
3850396 4231148 In our implementation, we use the binary SVMLight (Joachims, 1998) and modify the Tree Kernel Tools (Moschitti, 2004) to a grammardriven one
688622 4231125 Thus for instance, both REALPRO (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997) and SURGE (Elhadad and Robin, 1999) assume that the input associates semantic literals with low level syntactic and lexical information mostly leaving the realiser to just handle inflection, word order, insertion of grammatical words and agreement
